# Memcached-Auth
An node js module for accessing memcahceD session data

Requires unseralize which is included in this repo

Requires memcached node module @see https://www.npmjs.com/package/memcached

I have also included a server.js and client.js demo files of an chat app. 

The demo files arent not fully functional but should get you started.
